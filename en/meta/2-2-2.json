The reference population used in this report is based on WHO Child Growth Standards 89. The malnutrition of population can be measured by comparing children with this reference population. Each of three indicators - weight for age, height for age and weight for growth - can be expressed in units of standard deviation (z-score) based on the reference population median.","RATIONALE":"Weight for height can be used to estimate wasting or overweight. If weight for height of a child is below median of the reference population by more than two standard deviations, s/he classified as moderately or severely wasted child, by more than three standard deviations, as severely wasted. Malnutrition is usually the result of low nutrient intake or diseases. The prevalence of wasting can vary from season to season due to changes in food availability and/or spread of diseases. If weight for height of a child is above median of the reference population by more than two standard deviations, s/he classified as moderately or severely overweight child.","SOURCE_TYPE":"\u00abOn the situation of children and women\u00bb Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey conducted in the Kyrgyz Republic in accordance with the rounds of MICS international household survey.","COMPILING_ORG":"\u0412\u044b\u0431\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043e\u0431\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0448\u043d\u0438\u0445 \u0445\u043e\u0437\u044f\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432 \u00ab\u041e \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0449\u0438\u043d \u0438 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439\u00bb, \u0432\u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0430\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0439 \u043c\u043e\u0434\u0443\u043b\u044c \u00ab\u0410\u043d\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439 \u0432 \u0432\u043e\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0435 \u0434\u043e 5 \u043b\u0435\u0442\u00bb.
