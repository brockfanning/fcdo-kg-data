Informal unions are generally defined as those in which a couple lives together for some time, intends to have a lasting relationship, but for which there has been no formal civil or religious ceremony (i.e., cohabitation).","RATIONALE":"Marriage before the age of 18 is a fundamental violation of human rights. Child marriage often compromises a girl\u2019s development by resulting in early pregnancy and social isolation, interrupting her schooling, limiting her opportunities for career and vocational advancement and placing her at increased risk of intimate partner violence. In many cultures, girls reaching puberty are expected to assume gender roles associated with womanhood. These include entering a union and becoming a mother. The practice of early/child marriage is a direct manifestation of gender inequality. The issue of child marriage is addressed in a number of international conventions and agreements. Although marriage is not mentioned directly in the Convention on the Rights of the Child, child marriage is linked to other rights \u2013 such as the right to freedom of expression, the right to protection from all forms of abuse, and the right to be protected from harmful traditional practices.","SOURCE_TYPE":"Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS)","COMPILING_ORG":"\u0412 \u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0430\u0445 \u041a\u041e\u041c\u041f \u0438\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u0443\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0432\u044c\u044e \u0441 \u0438\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u044c\u044e\u0442\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0432 (ComputerAssisted Personal Interview, CAPI). \u041f\u0440\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0441\u0431\u043e\u0440\u0430 \u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445, \u0432 \u0442\u043e\u043c \u0447\u0438\u0441\u043b\u0435 \u0441\u043f\u0435\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430 \u0443\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u043c\u0438 \u041a\u041e\u041c\u041f, \u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043c\u043c\u043d\u043e\u043c \u043e\u0431\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0435\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 CSPro (Census and Survey Processing System) \u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0438\u0438 6.3. \u041f\u0440\u043e\u0446\u0435\u0434\u0443\u0440\u044b \u0438 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043c\u043c\u044b, \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0432 \u0440\u0430\u043c\u043a\u0430\u0445 \u0433\u043b\u043e\u0431\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439\n\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043c\u043c\u044b \u041a\u041e\u041c\u041f, \u0431\u044b\u043b\u0438 \u0430\u0434\u0430\u043f\u0442\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u044b \u043a \u043e\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0447\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0438\u0438 \u0432\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u041a\u041e\u041c\u041f \u041a\u044b\u0440\u0433\u044b\u0437\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d, 2018 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u0438 \u0438\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0441\u044c \u0432 \u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0435.","DATA_COMP":"Number of women aged 20-24 who were first married or in union before age 15 (or before age 18) divided by the total number of women aged 20-24 in the population multiplied by 100","REC_USE_LIM":"UNICEF Country Offices are invited to submit, through an online system, any updated data for a number of key indicators on the well-being of women and children.
