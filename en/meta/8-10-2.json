As financial inclusion is an individual-level concept, this is the appropriate measure. Other surveys that are done at household level may measure the access to finance through another member of the household which may overestimate financial inclusion.","COVERAGE":"The indicators in the 2014 Global Financial Inclusion (Global Findex) database are drawn from survey data covering almost 150,000 people in more than 140 economies representing more than 97 percent of the world\u2019s population. The survey was carried out over the 2014 calendar year by Gallup, Inc. as part of its\nGallup World Poll, which since 2005 has continually conducted surveys of approximately 1,000 people in each of more than 160 economies and in over 140 languages, using randomly selected, nationally representative samples. The target population is the entire civilian, non-institutionalized population age 15 and older.","disaggregation":"Disaggregated by sex, age, educational level urban/rural area.","COMPARABILITY":"World Bank\u2019s Global Findex database is based on individual level surveys worldwide, conducted every three years. The first round of the survey was done in 2011, and the second in 2014. The third round will be done in 2017. The database covers about 140 countries.
