The virus is more likely transmitted from mother to child and by contact with blood or other bodily fluids. The number of cases diagnosed for the first time is the number of newly recorded cases in the given year. The average annual population of general population is used to calculate Hepatitis B relative incidence.","RATIONALE":"Analyzing tuberculosis incidence allows assessing epidemiological situation in the country as a whole and by region, as well as effectiveness of treatment and preventive measures taken to combat tuberculosis. This indicator is also used to assess public health, social well-being and quality of treatment and preventive measures. Hepatitis B is preventable with safe, affordable and effective vaccines.","SOURCE_TYPE":"Data obtained from the State statistical reporting form \"Report on communicable, parasitic and non-communicable diseases\", as well as demographic statistics.","COMPILING_ORG":"\u0421\u0431\u043e\u0440 \u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u044d\u043a\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0438\u0437\u0432\u0435\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u043e \u0432\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u044b\u0435 \u0432 \u0436\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0438 \u0432\u044b\u044f\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u043c \u0438\u043d\u0444\u0435\u043a\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043d\u043e\u043c \u0437\u0430\u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0438, \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f\u0430\u044e\u0442 \u0432 \u0414\u0435\u043f\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0430\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442 \u0433\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0440\u043d\u043e-\u044d\u043f\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043c\u0438\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043d\u0430\u0434\u0437\u043e\u0440\u0430.
