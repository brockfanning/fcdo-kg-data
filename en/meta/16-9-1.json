Later in life, the lack of such documentation can mean that a child may enter into marriage or the labour market, or be conscripted into the armed forces, before the legal age. In adulthood, birth certificates may be required to obtain social assistance or a job in the formal sector, to buy or prove the right to inherit\nproperty, to vote and to obtain a passport.\nChildren\u2019s right to a name and nationality is enshrined in the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) under Article 7.
