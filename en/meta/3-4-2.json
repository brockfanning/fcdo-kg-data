Among causes are diseases, pathological conditions or injuries that lead to or contribute to death, as well as accidents or acts of violence that cause fatal injuries. Cause of death has been coded since 2000. Based on the World Health Organization 10 Revision of International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Injuries, and Causes of Death (ICD-10).","RATIONALE":"Analyzing this indicator allows assessing effectiveness of preventive measures against suicides. Suicide rate is also used to assess public health and quality of treatment and preventive measures. ","SOURCE_TYPE":"Cause of death information is obtained from medical death certificates drawn up by doctors or mid-level medical personnel regarding disease, accident, homicide, suicide and other external influences resulting in death. These documents, along with civil registration of deaths drawn up by civil registry offices (which are subordinate to the State Registration Service), are sent to statistical agencies for calculation. Of causes listed, one is selected for statistical purposes - the primary, i.e. the disease or injury that caused events directly leading to death. Aggregated data are collected and processed by the regional statistical offices and the NSC.","COMPILING_ORG":"\u0421\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043e \u0441\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0442\u044f\u0445 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0430\u044e\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0435\u0436\u0435\u0433\u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u043a\u0438 \u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445, \u0441\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0430\u0449\u0438\u0445\u0441\u044f \u0432 \u0430\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0445 \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0441\u044f\u0445 \u043e \u0441\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0442\u0438, \u0441\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u043c\u044b\u0445 \u043e\u0440\u0433\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0438 \u0430\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u044f\u043d\u0438\u044f.  \u0410\u0433\u0440\u0435\u0433\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0441\u043e\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0430\u044e\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0438 \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0431\u0430\u0442\u044b\u0432\u0430\u044e\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043d\u044b\u043c\u0438 \u0443\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f\u043c\u0438 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u0438 \u041d\u0421\u041a \u041a\u0420.","DATA_COMP":"Suicide rates to average annual population according to current estimate calculated per 100,000 population.","REC_USE_LIM":"The complete recording of suicide deaths in death-registration systems requires good linkages with police systems, but can be seriously impeded by stigma, social and legal considerations, and delays in determining cause of death.
