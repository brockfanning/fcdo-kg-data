This training is provided to children who, for one reason or another, are not enrolled in kindergartens, but need to be \"trained\" to enter first grade. Children are taken care of by specially trained teachers.\nPre-schooling, unlike kindergarten, where children stay all day, lasts three to six hours per day. Learning process is aimed at solving issues of socialization and adaptation of 6-year-olds to new conditions and teaching children basic skills of communication, cooperation, interaction and overcoming psycho-social barriers.","RATIONALE":"The indicator measures children\u2019s exposure to organized learning activities in the year prior to the start of primary school.
